## Next Steps (Rewrite)
- [x] Remove TexturePool entirely.
- [ ] Implement one time texture init for layer2D and atlas2D
- [ ] Cleanup entity2D
- [x] Reimplement TextureAtlas2D.
- [ ] Increase use of ECS paradigm.
- [ ] Increase simplicity of Layer2D to be used directly by a user.
- [ ] Increase overall simplicity and reduce abstraction.
- [ ] Make complex high performance paths optional
- [ ] Make layers and their atlases not allow dynamic addition and removal of textures
- [x] Fix incorrect buffer allocation / entity copying
- [ ] Fix (shaders maybe?) to use correct texture atlas coordinates
  - store total width and height in layer atlas then use to calc exact tex position
- [x] Fix tex aspect ratio
- [ ] Remove * 10.0 in vertex group when texture atlas complete
- [ ] Fix issues where entity buffers aren't updated correctly
- [ ] Fix entity positioning being incorrect
  - [ ] Implement 2D transformations first
- [ ] Fix broken buffers
