## Next Steps (Rewrite)
- [x] Remove TexturePool entirely.
- [ ] Implement one time texture init for layer2D and atlas2D
- [ ] Cleanup entity2D
- [x] Reimplement TextureAtlas2D.
- [ ] Increase use of ECS paradigm.
- [ ] Increase simplicity of Layer2D to be used directly by a user.
- [ ] Increae overall simplicity and reduce abstraction.
- [ ] Make complex high performance paths optional
- [ ] Make layers and their atlases not allow dynamic addition and removal of textures
- [ ] Fix incorrect buffer allocation / entity copying
